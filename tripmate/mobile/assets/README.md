# Assets Directory

This directory contains the app assets referenced in `app.json`.

## Required Assets

The following assets are referenced in the Expo configuration but need to be created:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon

## Placeholder Assets

For development purposes, you can use placeholder images or create simple colored squares with the TripMate branding.

## Asset Guidelines

- **App Icon**: 1024x1024px, PNG format, should work well at small sizes
- **Splash Screen**: Should match your app's design, typically 1242x2436px for iPhone X
- **Adaptive Icon**: 1024x1024px, should work with Android's adaptive icon system
- **Favicon**: 32x32px or 16x16px, PNG or ICO format

## Creating Assets

You can create these assets using:
- Design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD
- Online icon generators
- Simple image editing software

For now, the app will work without these assets, but they should be added before production deployment.
